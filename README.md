## FAQ

### Can I customize this component in my own way?

This library makes some calls to keep the API easy to use and maintain.

## Prior Art and Inspirations

I am huge fan of simple, easy APIs that take care of 90% of jobs easily.
One form library I really enjoyed was https://kozea.github.io/formol/ .
The API was simple in all of the ways that I love, but there were some aspects of the library that just didn't fit for us and our workflow.
I wanted to make something that was more simple, but just as easy but with more configuration options.
I'm also inspired by AutoForm for Meteor https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform for future generation features.
